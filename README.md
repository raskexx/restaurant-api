Restaurant API
=======

**To read this document in Brazilian Portuguese, access the [README.pt-br.md](README.pt-br.md) file.**

REST API to manage a restaurant with local and online orders (delivery).

## Challenge

### Use Cases

#### Types of orders:

- Orders made at the restaurant.
- Orders made online for delivery (partners).

#### Cooking system

- As a cook I should be able to view all orders placed (on site / delivery) in the order of arrival.
- As a cook I should be able to change the order status to indicate that the order is being prepared.
- As a cook I should be able to change the order status to indicate that the order is ready.
- As a waiter I should be able to change the order status to indicate that the order has been delivered.

#### Table System

- As a customer I must be able to place an order, choosing a burger and a drink.
- As a customer I must be able to check the order status, to see if it is already being prepared.
- As a customer I must be able to check the value of the bill at any moment.

#### Online orders (API)

- A partner must be able to send an order through the API, stating the order items and the delivery address.
- A partner should be able to check the order status.

## Motivation

Learn new technologies, libraries and ensure good coverage tests.

- [RESTEasy] (http://resteasy.jboss.org/) - Build a REST webservice, the choice was RESTEasy.
- [REST-assured] (https://code.google.com/p/rest-assured/) - This library was chosen due to its simplicity to test and validate REST services.
- [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/) - As a document database, it was chosen to best represent the structure of an order (products, quantity and delivery data) and also the excellent reading performance.
- [Jongo] (http://www.jongo.org/) - This library was chosen to allow the use of MongoDB in Java and also its great performance.

## Future Improvements

- **Cache**

- **Authentication**

	Implement OAuth2.

- **Dependency Injection**

	Spring.

## Requirements

- Java 7
- Jetty 9
- MongoDB 2.6.4

## Configuration

### MongoDB

1 - [Download] (http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) MongoDB 2.6.4 for the version of your operating system.

2 - Follow the installation recommendations and start the server

`` Html
$ mongod
`` `
